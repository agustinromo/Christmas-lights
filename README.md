# Christmas-lights
I made a christmas lights for your desk tree or plant using the charlieplexing method with 12 leds and an Ardunio Mega, Programming language C
This file contains with two charlieplexing examples(charlyplexing and Mycharly) the first one is an example of a trhee led charlieplexing, the second one
is my example with 12 leds, then the code named "christmas lights" is the main one which contains with the charlieplexing with 12 leds and the interrumptions
for setting your leds as you wish. I hope you can be able to understand it all, I'd like to recomend you to learn much more about what charlieplexing is and how it works.
